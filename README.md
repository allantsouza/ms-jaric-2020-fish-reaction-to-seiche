# ms-jaric-2020-fish-reaction-to-seiche
This branch is intended to host the file versions from all collaborators before the starndardization in github.

Each researcher can upload their files into their specific folder (folder with surname in small caps).

After all files are uploaded, there will be a standardization and transfer of the code to the develop branch.
